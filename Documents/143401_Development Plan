Core Quadrant

Step 2:
G: Goal
- I would like to learn how to manage a java front end and backend in conjunction with a database.
- If possible I would like to integrate security elements, such as a hashing api to store the usernames and passwords in a secure 
- How to create and publish android apps on the Appstore, as well as transition from a desktop app to something usable on the android platform.

R: Reality
- Thus far in the project we are up to date and even a little ahead of the game with our planning. The team seems to get along well, and I feel confident in our ability to work effectively as a team. 
- Something that could be improved about the current state of the project is how we are structuring our planning and documentation. I feel that we need a more consistent method of storing and accessing this information, as well as finding an effective format to store the information in. 

O: Options
- Attending the lectures as a baseline for the information that is required for me to know.
- For the most part I will be conducting research my self and teaching my self how to do the things required. I will be using mainly text sources and api documentations for the languages, and Stackoverflow and Youtube for implementation information.
- Discussion with the TA for anything that I donâ€™t understand.

W: Will
- Primarily follow deadlines and stick to the plan that we set as a team.
- The first step that can be taken to bring us closer to the end goal is by following the first two things in the issues section of our github, which is investigating current apps and creating a DB Schema.
- This is starting now, as we are already making and planning, and editing the gitlab by setting issues and boards.
