Strong points

•	Keeping track of project requirement and scoping accordingly.

How is this point shown in a team?
Through input and questioning in the brainstorming meeting throughout the different sprints/project fases. Adjusting the scoping accordingly. 


Do you have examples of this?
Have participated in and had the responsibily over softwareprojects where the requirements where vague and communication with different stakeholders was required to get a concrete and doable project within the given timeframe.

•	Communicating with team members.

How is this point shown in a team?
Having regular meetings and updates about each others work and finding out if there are any obstacles. Keeping all team members engage and informed so that nobody feels left out.

Do you have examples of this?
Same example as the last point.

Weak points 
•	Writing documentation and reports, getting stuck with it.

Do you have examples of this?
I have got stuck on most reports I’ve had to write. Needing to ask input of others to get going again.

How is this point shown in a team?
Me asking more input from other team members on how to move forward with documentation or reports.

•	Not having enough patience to get the details right.
	
Do you have examples of this?
Finishing tasks in an hastly manner so that it contains bugs.	

How is this point shown in a team?
Not taking the time to double check all delivered work.

G – Goal

•	Learn how to build desktop applications that interact with a database and how this differs from web applications.
-	Why is this important to me? Having only built web applications in the past I am curious about the difference between the different platforms.
•	Building applications using a strictly typed language.
- Why is this important to me? Having only used scripting languages in the past I am curious about the difference between the different types of languages.

•	Building and delivering fully tested code.
- Why is this important to me? I’ve only built project without a lot of formal testing in the past. I would like to see and learn how much benefit there is to delivering fully tested code.

•	Delivering fully documented code.
- Why is this important to me? I’ve only built project without without a lot of formal documentation in the past. I would like to see and learn how much benefit there is to delivering fully documented code.



R - Reality 

•	For this moment I am researching the the javaFX platform and how connections with databases are done in java.
•	In order to deliver fully tested code I am trying to understand the workflow of continuous integration and the different testing methods.

O - Options (Look at possible options)

•	Building the application and seeing how the different parts are developed in a desktop strictly typed environment.
•	Making sure every part of my delivered code is fully tested with help of unit and integration tests. 
•	Making sure every part of my delivered code is fully documented with respect to the rules given by the project requirements.

What is stopping you reaching your goal?

For the goal of developing a strictly typed desktop application. Reaching my goal could be hindered by me taking on a lot of tasks I am already familiar with which can result into not having enough time to learn new concepts.

For the goals of delivering fully tested and documented code. Reaching my goals could be hindered by me falling back on old habits of delivering code fast because of time pressure. 


W - Will 

I am going to reach my goals by actively trying to find opportunities to learn programming concepts I’m unfamiliar with. When I am working on these tasks I will not consider them done until they are fully tested and documented. My teammates can help me reaching my goal by making sure my code is reviewed before being accepted. My first concrete step towards my goal is reading the documentation on Integrated testing and on JavaFX
