**Personal development plan**

Strong points:
    
*  Able to fully be focused on what I'm doing/coding, sometimes being nonresponsive.
*  Pushing through with stuff even if it's a bumpy ride, motivating others to keep working.

Weak points: 
    
*  Going into too much detail and kinda wasting time on perfecting small things, bringing up things that should be done later after the basics.
*  Easily becoming down if something doesn't work, in a team this results in me telling my coworkers what's wrong.

**Grow Goal**

Goal:
*  Writing clear comments and commit desciptions, this is important because it is make the teamwork way easier and will improve my code writing. I will have succeeded if nobody asks me what I have done.
*  Gaining more experience in coding and getting to firsthand see the stuff surrounding a production of an application.

Reality:
* Currently I'm working on coding and I'm improving on my commit messages but my comments are not as clear yet.
* During the project the experience will come.

Options: 
*  I'm able to practise on my goals everytime I program in and outside of this project, however outside of the project I do not yet have the urgency to write good comments if I write solo.
*  During the project we will tackle a lot of stuff surrounding production of an application, however it is highly unlikely to be able to deeply being involved on all the aspects.

W:
*  I will achieve my goal by keeping up and trying to make a habit of writing good comments and commit descriptions. I will be pushed by my team members as it is necessary to write good comments for clarity.
*  I'm hoping I have achieved my goal at the end of the project by staying involved in/ keeping up on what the others are doing.
