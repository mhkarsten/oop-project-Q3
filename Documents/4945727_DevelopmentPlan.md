What are two of your strong points?
-I am disciplined and highly ambitious.
Do you have examples of this? 
-In the past, whenever I was into some project or assignment I would make it an all-out effort to get the best grade possible.
How is this point shown in a team?
-I'm pretty confident that even when the going gets tough I will still be working hard and trying to motivate others.
What are two of your weaker points?
-When things are not going to plan, more specifically when people in my group don't deliver when they said they would, I tend to assume the role of taskmaster.
Though sometimes this can be just what is needed to get back on track, more often it will result in bad blood within a team. Also, my ambition comes sided with a measure of perfectionism.
Do you have examples of this?
In the same projects I got good grades for, there was often some conflict along the way, caused by either pressing on a bit too hard towards a deadline or being somewhat blunt in the way I reviewed others' work.
How is this point shown in a team?
As mentioned before, sometimes the virtue of ambition turn into the vice of hyper-criticism, meaning that I start asking too much of both myself and my team and deliver this feedback in a non-constructive way which adversely affects the team spirit.
Can you make a core quadrant of this?
For the hypercritical attitude, yes:
Core quality: Ambition
Pitfall: Setting standards too high
Challenge: Toning down the critique and taking it easy for once
Allergy: slacking attitude and/or low-quality work delivered

Goal
What is your learning goal during this course?
-I want to learn to be a better critic so that my feedback can inspire instead of talking people down.
This is important to me because being a good critic is a valuable asset in many situations, not just in a professional or academic environment.
I think this will be a gradual process so I hope to have gained some ground by the end of this project.
-I would like to learn good version management using git, as this is key in coding as a team.
This is important to me because besides it being of paramount importance in groupwork, my personal projects' version management is also a mess so some git skills would be more than welcome.
I hope to be well on my way towards achieving this goal during the first few weeks of this project.
-In addition, I would like to learn how to combine all the various technologies (the database, the app) into one final product.
Understanding the grand scheme of things when it comes to real applications is very useful as someone involved in software. I expect to achieve this to some degree by the end of the project.

Reality
-I'm reflecting on it and writing this document so if that counts for something I am, but as the project has hardly begun there has not really been any moment to work towards two of my goals. I have started learning about version management though.
-The team seems motivated and gets along well and we have already started working on some of the specifics so that's good.
-One thing I did notice is that during our first meeting there were talkers and listeners at times. I think that we should collectively try to keep the discussion pro-active by sometimes quite literally asking for someone's opinion, especially if we are joined by our sixth group member, as it is easy for unheard good ideas to be drowned out in a group setting. I don't think it is a serious problem (yet).

Options
As the other problems are relatively easy to address, I will discuss only the first and primary goal, becoming a better critic.
I think that if I try to be conscious at all times of how I evaluate the work of others, I will be well on my way towards becoming a better critic.
Additionally, I could occasionally ask for some metacritique when relevant.
I think that nothing is stopping me from achieving my goal.

Will
As mentioned above, I will make a conscious effort to deliver better, more constructive feedback.
This starts as the first work is done and evaluated, which will be somewhere in the second week.
As for a first step I can take right now, I will read up on some relevant tips. My teammates can help me by just giving me a heads up if I'm overly critical or blunt.
The action plan need not be formalized, as it simply entails one process that can be evaluated at the end of each sprint until the end of the project is reached.
