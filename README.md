## Pandey, Harshitaa

What are two of your strong points?
I think that I am a good communicator, and I am also a very motivated worker.

How is this point shown in a team?
This is very clearly shown in a group, as I constantly have to be in contact with other members of the group. The motivation would come in when there are problems with our code, and I just need to persevere through it.

What are two of your weaker points?
I think I get frustrated pretty easily, and also I get distracted pretty easily.

Do you have examples of this?
Yes, there’s been multiple times where I’ve needed to step back from a project and come back at a different time because I have been so frustrated. I get distracted all the time while doing tasks, as I have tendency to talk.

How is this point shown in a team?
This is shown in a team when we reach a problem which we can not solve, and I also need to be aware of the fact that I talk a lot and this could distract the rest of the team members and myself.

G - Goal
What is your learning goal during this course?
I want to be able to work well in a group, and able to do everything within the deadline.
Why is this important to you
I think these are both very important things to learn, and they become especially important in the workplace.
When will you have succeeded in achieving this goal?
Well, it would depend. I would hopefully have “succeeded”by the end of the quarter.

R - Reality (Your current situation)
Are you actively working on your goal?
Yes, I am. I think it is going well but I still talk a lot.

O - Options (Look at possible options)
What are options you have to achieve your goal?
I just need to be aware, and know what I am doing. As of right now, nothing is stopping me.

W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)
What are you going to do to reach your goal?
I will make sure that I don’t talk a lot and I keep making plans for the deadlines. I also need to organize the tasks so that everyone knows what they are doing. Currently, we are making a plan to do that.
