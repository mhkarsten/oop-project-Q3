**Personal development plan**

Strong points:
    
*  Able to fully be focused on what I'm doing/coding, sometimes being nonresponsive.
*  Pushing through with stuff even if it's a bumpy ride, motivating others to keep working.

Weak points: 
    
*  Going into too much detail and kinda wasting time on perfecting small things, bringing up things that should be done later after the basics.
*  Easily becoming down if something doesn't work, in a team this results in me telling my coworkers what's wrong.
