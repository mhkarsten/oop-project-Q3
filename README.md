**Personal development plan**

Strong points:
    
*  -Able to fully be focused on what I'm doing/coding 

*  -Pushing through with stuff even if it's a bumpy ride

Weak points: 
    
*  -Going into too much detail and kinda wasting time on perfecting small things.

*  -Easily becoming down if something doesn't work
