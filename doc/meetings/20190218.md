1.	Introduction
2.	Agenda items
    1. This week
        1. We need to start planning ahead
        2. We need to get a simple client-server interaction going
    2. The coming weeks
        1. Write a rapport enveloping the gist of the sprint meeting, sprint agenda and the retrospective.
        2. Have a meeting agenda set up! (Because writing this retrospectively is ugly)
    3. Final report: We only have to deliver the final report by the end of the project but if we write one every week reviewing a sprint is easier and making a final report is trivial.
