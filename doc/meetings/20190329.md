This week:

Max, Thom and Jason work on the finishing the features and testing.



### Question:

Do we have to test getters/setters
- Free coverage so it’s better to test them.

Do people get the full points for the rapport?
- Last year andy graded them but it’s not 0 or 1.
- In the slides of the first presentation more extensive specifications/outline of document.
- Where is the most value added, If we want to cover the application in the presentation that’s fine.


### Issues:

- Looked at the merge request, The names are not specific enough. Change them into something meaningfull about the feature being pushed.
- Issue board has unassigned items in doing.

### Deadlines next week:
-  hand-in final rapport.
-  Features, achievements, friends.
