Chair: Team 1
Secretary: Thom van der Woude
(I missed the first part of the meeting :( )

1.	Introduction
2.	Agenda items
	- Going through presentation
		- Sander suggested a more explicit style for problem discussion, star method
		- It is better to discuss everything a little than to focus on a few strong points of our application (this is how it is graded I guess)
		- David says we should just focus on the (technical) sales pitch
	- Demo of application
		- Some GUI things could be tweaked
		- Anything that doesn't break the program (background exceptions etc.) is fine
	- Report: much better but some things can be improved still
		- Footnotes as opposed to literature references: some references should be more formal than others
		- Value Sensitive Design seems alright
3.  Question round (for the TA)
4.	Any Other Business
	- Note on TA help: David also has tests so Wednesday night is the latest he will respond for sure to questions.
5.	Action Points
	- Stop coding Wednesday/Thursday, don't end up breaking the code and spending your valuable time trying to fix it!
6.	Next meeting: there is no next meeting. Maybe a beer sometime after this is all over?
7.	Closing - ~17:30

I guess that's it.
