# Meetings folder

### From agendas to minutes
The idea is that by saturday night every week, we have submitted both the minutes (filled in agenda so to speak) of that weeks meeting and the agenda for the next meeting. Markdown is used for the notes and the filenames follow the convention <YEAR><MONTH><DAY>.md, so for example `20190214.md`. The idea is to just supplement the given agenda bulletpoints with relevant notes and things mentioned during the meeting.

### The agenda
Everyone should contribute to the next week's agenda. In turn, the secretary is responsible for noting all that is discussed in an orderly fashion and submitting the week's notes to this folder (see the agenda template provided).
