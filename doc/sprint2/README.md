# The Sprint

Every week there are a few documents that have to be submitted by saturday night: 
Four things looking back at the past sprint:
- meeting notes
- sprint retrospective
- sprint review
- final report

Two things for the next sprint 
- agenda
- sprint backlog

Be sure to commit your work to the right sprint and follow the name convention of DATE_DOCUMENTTYPE.xyz, so `20190213_sprint_review.xyz` for a review.
