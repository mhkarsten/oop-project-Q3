To start off the project, we researched other apps which were avaliable on the market currently. We were able to find an app called 'JouleBug' which was regarding the same topic that we are doing our own project about. Some of the inspiration that we took from this app was regarding the setup and the features that were included. There were lots of badges, notifications,and a trending section which we want to include in our own project in the future.
